using 'pyenv' to manage python versions, using 2.7.9 for this tut
change with:
[
	$ pyenv versions
	* system
	  2.7.9

	$ pyenv global 2.7.9
]

remember when you go production: pip install pillow
* 3.2.7 of tut has a great thing about sharing a package list


Set this up later: https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/

goals:

- user can add a show and a group of people they are watching with
- user can see shows they are watching and their progress


todo: fix it so that you do 127.0.0.1:8000/ instead of needing the /main/
