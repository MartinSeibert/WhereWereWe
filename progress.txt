using 'pyenv' to manage python versions, using 2.7.9 for this tut
change with:
[
	$ pyenv versions
	* system
	  2.7.9

	$ pyenv global 2.7.9
]

remember when you go production: pip install pillow
* 3.2.7 of tut has a great thing about sharing a package list


Set this up later: https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/

goals:

- user can add a show and a group of people they are watching with
- user can see shows they are watching and their progress


todo: fix it so that you do 127.0.0.1:8000/ instead of needing the /main/

at some point, postgresql may make more sense than sqlite but for now sqlite will do just fine

NOTE: Whenever you add to existing models, you will have to repeat this process running python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>, and then python manage.py migrate

NOTE: to customize the admin interface, check out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/admin/
Also see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial02/

NOTE: Look at section (6.7. Creating a Population Script) for instructions to generate test data programatically

got to "7.3.3. Category Page Workflow

With our URLs design chosen, let’s get started. We’ll undertake the following steps."
on page http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/chapters/models_templates.html

NOTE: if you want to change a field from a primitive to a ManyToMany, you must first remove the field, makemigrations, and then migrate. After that, add the ManyToMany, makemigrations, and migrate.

NOTE: TO INSTALL PILLOW:
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib

	pip install pillow

NOTE: Be sure to change the password hashing mechanism to bcrypt or something more secure than the default

NOTE: There is more information about how to authenticate user emails and things of that sort at 9.8. Exercises on http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/chapters/login.html

NOTE: You can further abstract template blocks, details here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/templates/#id1


ISSUE: A show can be added that already exists, which causes problems if you try to view that show

At some point, change login and register to use forms from forms.py rather than an inline form

At some point, provide users with password change functionality (http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/chapters/login_redux.html)
